# cluster-api-provider-yandex
Infrastructure Cluster API provider for YandexCloud

## Description
Provide an opportunity to deploy kubernetes clusters based on YandexCloud Compute via Cluster API 

## Compatibility with Cluster API
This provider's versions are compatible with the following versions of Cluster API:
|             |Cluster API v1beta1 (v1.x)|
|:------------|:------------------------:|
|CAPY v1alpha1|✓|

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
#### Requirements

- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+
- kubectl version v1.11.3+
- clusterctl version v1.5.0+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

#### Service Account
To create and manage clusters, this infrastructure provider uses a service account to authenticate with YC’s APIs.

Follow [these instructions](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/operations/sa/create) to create a new service account. Then [add](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa#binding-role-resource) the following roles to the service account:
- [compute.editor](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/compute/security/#compute-editor) 
- [alb.editor](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/roles-reference#alb-editor)

Next, [generate a JSON key](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/operations/authorized-key/create) and store it in a safe place.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
export IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-yandex:tag
make docker-build docker-push
```

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Create secret with YC key**
```
kubectl create secret generic yc-sa-key --from-file=</path/to/serviceaccount-key.json> -n capy-system
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy
```

**Generate workload cluster manifests**
```sh
export YANDEX_CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_IMAGE_ID=<compute-image-id>
export YANDEX_FOLDER_ID=<folder-id>
export YANDEX_SUBNET_ID=<subnet-id>
export YANDEX_NETWORK_ID=<network-id>
clusterctl generate cluster <some-cluster-name> --from templates/cluster-template.yaml > /tmp/capy-cluster.yaml
```

**Deploy generated cluster**

```sh
kubectl apply -k /tmp/capy-cluster.yaml
```

**Install CCM**
See https://github.com/deckhouse/yandex-cloud-controller-manager

**Install CNI**
See https://github.com/cilium/cilium

### API Server Endpoint
API server load balancer listener receive dynamic IP address from a network with YANDEX_SUBNET_ID provided. You can provide fixed IP address from YANDEX_SUBNET_ID, adding `address` field to YandexCluster loadBalancer specification, for example:
```yaml
  loadBalancer:
    listener:
      address: 10.101.10.10
      subnet:
        id: <you subnet ID>
```
Note: The `loadBalancer` specification cannot be modified after cluster creation.

### To Uninstall
**Delete cluster CRs:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k /tmp/capy-cluster.yaml
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
